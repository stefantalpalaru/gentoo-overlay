LinuxTag Green OpenMusic License
Draft v1.1, 22 April 2001

I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS

The OpenMusic works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows: Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Green OpenMusic License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently available at http://openmusic.linuxtag.org/). The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher of the work (see section VI). The refence must be incoporated in any publication of the work, either physical or electronic. If the work is broadcasted, or the reference can not be incorporated by physical means, the reference can be ommitted with prior permission obtained from the copyright holder.

Commercial redistribution of OpenMusic-licensed material is permitted.

Any publication in physical form (like a CD) shall require the citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the product. On all outer surfaces of the product the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.

II. COPYRIGHT

The copyright to each OpenMusic is owned by its author(s) or designee. If the work covered by this license is bound to a specific transport medium (see section VI), it is possible for the author(s) or designee to publish the work on a different medium covered by a different license.

III. SCOPE OF LICENSE

The following license terms apply to all OpenMusic works, unless otherwise explicitly stated.

Mere aggregation of OpenMusic works or a portion of an OpenMusic work with other works on the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the OpenMusic material and appropriate copyright notice.

SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.

NO WARRANTY. OpenMusic works are licensed and provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.

IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS

All modified versions of works covered by this license, including partial works incorporated into new works, must meet the following requirements:

    The modified version must be labeled as such.
    The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.
    The location of the original unmodified work must be identified.
    The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting work without the original author's (or authors') permission.
    The new work has to be released under precisely this License, with the modified version filling the role of the work, thus licensing distribution and modification of the modified version to whoever possesses a copy of it. 

V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that: If you are distributing OpenMusic works in physical form, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated works. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the work. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be described in an attachment to the work. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any physical form expression of an OpenMusic-licensed work to its author(s).

VI. MEDIA LOCKING OPTION

The author(s) and/or publisher of an OpenMusic-licensed document may bind any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part on a specific transport medium (for example "digital distribution via the Internet"). Exceptions can be made with prior permission from the copyright holder.

This option is selected by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. This option is considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.

To accomplish this, add the phrase "Distribution of the work or derivative of the work is restricted to <insert medium here> unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder." to the license reference or copy.

OPEN MUSIC POLICY APPENDIX:

(This is not considered part of the license.)

OpenMusic works are available in source format via the OpenMusic home page at http://openmusic.linuxtag.org/.

OpenMusic artists who want to include their own license on OpenMusic works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the OpenMusic license.
